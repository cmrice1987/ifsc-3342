    <h2>My Assessment</h2> <!-- Hey Thomas-->
    <p><img src="assets/img/content-image2.jpg" alt="The most interesting man in the world" class="img-right"/>The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simplicity . Often, simple things are clear if the message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data. </p>
    <p class="alert">This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of data, as simplification usually does. </p>
    <p>Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination of it.</p>

    <p>Please answer the following questions below. Remember to markup the information properly using HTML</p>
    <h4>Explain the difference between the &quot;alt&quot; attribute and the &quot;title&quot; attribute. </h4>
    <p>An &quot;ALT&quot; is a require attribute that read an image as text if imagae can not be displayed. An &quto;TITLE&quot; attribute gives extra information to an element but is not require.</p>
